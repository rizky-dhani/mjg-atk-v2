# Visual Identity
*   **Modern & Minimalist:** The system leverages the core Filament v4 aesthetic, prioritizing high contrast, ample whitespace, and clean typography to reduce cognitive load.
*   **Color as Information:** Utilize a utility-first color system where colors (e.g., success green, warning amber, danger red) are used purposefully to indicate status and urgency.

# Communication Tone
*   **Helpful & Direct:** System messages and notifications should use clear, jargon-free language. The goal is to guide the user efficiently through the inventory and approval lifecycle.

# User Experience (UX) Patterns
*   **Explicit Drafting:** Users have full control over their work-in-progress. Stock requests and usages are only persisted as drafts when the user explicitly chooses to save them.
*   **Proactive Validation:** Real-time inline validation provides immediate feedback, helping users correct errors as they happen and reducing friction during the final submission.
*   **Frictionless Approvals:** The mobile experience is optimized for "Review and Decide." Approvers are provided with essential context and one-tap actions to move requests through the workflow without delay.

# Quality Standards
*   **Data Integrity:** Every inventory movement must be recorded with its associated user, division, and timestamp.
*   **Accessibility:** Adhere to WCAG standards to ensure the dashboard is usable by all team members, regardless of their interaction method.
