# Proposal: Add Approve/Reject Buttons to AtkTransferStocks for Existing Approval Flow

This proposal outlines the implementation of "Approve" and "Reject" buttons within the Filament admin panel for `AtkTransferStock` records. These buttons will leverage the existing approval flow mechanism already defined for the `AtkTransferStock` model, providing a direct way for authorized users to manage transfer requests.
