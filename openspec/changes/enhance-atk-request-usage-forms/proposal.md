# Proposal: Enhance ATK Stock Request and Usage Forms Readability

This proposal aims to improve the readability and user experience of the `AtkStockRequest` and `AtkStockUsage` creation and update forms in Filament. This will be achieved by:
1.  Displaying the `unit_of_measure` alongside the quantity requested field for each item.
2.  Restructuring and enhancing the presentation of the "Current, Max, and Available" stock information section.
