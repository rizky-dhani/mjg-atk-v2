# Proposal: Link Status Widgets to List Pages with Applied Filters

This proposal outlines the enhancement of status-related widgets (`AtkStockRequestStatus`, `AtkStockUsageStatus`, and `AtkTransferStockStatus`) to be clickable. When clicked, these widgets will navigate the user to the corresponding list page (e.g., `AtkStockRequests` list page) with the relevant status filter pre-applied. This will improve user navigation and efficiency in managing items by status.
