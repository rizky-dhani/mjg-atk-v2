# Proposal: Set System Default Language to Bahasa Indonesia

This proposal outlines the steps to configure the application's default language to Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian language). This change will ensure that all system-generated messages, UI labels, and localized content are presented in Bahasa by default, improving accessibility for Indonesian-speaking users.
