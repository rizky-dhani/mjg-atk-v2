# Proposal: Display Approver Name and Position in AtkStockRequest View Page

This proposal outlines the implementation to display the names and positions of approvers involved in an `AtkStockRequest`'s Approval Flow directly on the `AtkStockRequest` View page. This information will be visible even if the approvers have not yet acted on the request, providing transparency into the approval process.
